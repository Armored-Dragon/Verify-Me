## Overview
Verify Me is a self-hosted Discord moderator bot that is focused on transparency. Verify-Me accomplishes this by being completely open source and self hosted.
You always know what code is being executed and what data is being collected, because this bot is yours!

The scope of this bot is to be a secure moderation bot for personal servers.
You will create the Discord bot account, give Verify-Me the bot token, and you can use the bot for up to 100 of your servers!

## Setup
Setup for this is very straight forward. This is assuming you have the latest version of Node.JS.

1. Clone the repository into a folder on your machine
2. Create a file under the /data directory titled "private_bot_data.json" (If it does not already exist)
3. In the new file, write `{ "token": "<Your Bot Token>" }`  (Don't have a bot token? See [this wiki page](https://github.com/Armored-Dragon/Verify-Me/wiki/CreateABot))
4. From the root of the repository, execute the command "node bot/verify_me.js"

With that last step, your bot should be fully functional and waiting for you to set it up for each server.
